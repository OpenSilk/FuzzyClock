Yes, another fuzzy clock clone

Not fuzzy like kitties but fuzzy as in 'not precise'. Before cell phones, when asked
for the time, one might reply something like 'five after six'. Fuzzy clock aims
to do this with text; displaying the time in a human readable fashion. Fuzzy clock is
intentionally minimalistic, there is no date, am/pm, or weather. Just a rough estimate
of what time it is.

           The first half of the hour runs slow and creeps along, behind
           the actual time. Giving you a few extra minutes complete your task.
           The second half of the hour races, skipping ahead... into the future.
           Giving you some extra minutes to commute or prepare. Getting you out
           the door and where you need to be on time.
